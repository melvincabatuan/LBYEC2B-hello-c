# Welcome to LBYEC2B (C Programming)
This is an example assignment where we familiarize our Github classroom workflow.

### The assignment
Write a C program that prints the string "Hello, World!".
The tests are currently failing because we're printing the wrong string. 
Correcting the `printf` will fix the tests.
